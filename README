I'm almost finished fixing all of the bugs and problems that were persisting in the book tutorial. I'm going to start implementing the changes I want to the book scmup. I'm going to start by getting the mechanics to work before starting to work on the visuals. This entails making 4 different enemy varieties, making 4 different blaster varieties, and making sure the blaster variations match up with the enemy varieties. I'm going to start with getting two to work and then moving from there.
