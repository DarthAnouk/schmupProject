## Summary
My schmup project focuses on the use of multi-colored weaponry to attack enemy spacecraft of the same multi-colored varieties.

## Mechanics
The interesting mechanic that differs my game from the one created in the book is the fact that each of the varying enemy ships have different colors and must be destroyed by the same colored blaster in order to take damage and be destroyed. If the enemy is hit by a blaster that doesn't match its color, then it will not take damage.
