##Process Documentation
The creation of my schmup was difficult. I realized over halfway through the project that the reason so much of my project wasn't working was because I was using the old version of the book instead of the new version. After switching to the new version of our textbook, the work went a lot faster and I was able to make the mechanical changes I wanted to make. In the old book, the author uses a delegate for firing missiles without explaining it fully. In the new book he explains the code for firing and then adds a delegate to control it, so I was able to figure out the code I wanted without the delegate. Below, you can see the actual in-progress posts I made while working on the project.

### 2019.09.24
Set up my project in Unity and in GitHub.

### 2019.09.30
Set up the project as laid out in Ch. 30 of the textbook.

### 2019.10.04
Nothing is moving. Everything is broken. Let the debugging commence

### 2019.10.09
The class was given an extension on the project due to the amount of people behind on the project. I too fell into this boat because I was so far behind.

### 2019.10.12
I'm almost finished fixing all of the bugs and problems that were persisting in the book tutorial. I'm going to start implementing the changes I want to the book scmup. I'm going to start by getting the mechanics to work before starting to work on the visuals. This entails making 4 different enemy varieties, making 4 different blaster varieties, and making sure the blaster variations match up with the enemy varieties. I'm going to start with getting two to work and then moving from there.
